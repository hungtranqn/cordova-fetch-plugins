# Cordova/Ionic plugin downloader utility

This small command will help you save time when setting up an existing project on a new environment (CI for example), by automatically download all needed cordova plugins registered in the file `plugins/fetch.json`. Normally each installed plugin is registered into this file.

# Install

`npm install -g cordova-fetch-plugins`

# Usage

Execute this command at the root of your project :
`fetch-plugins`
